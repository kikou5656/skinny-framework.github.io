### 2.2 Migration Guide for 2.1.x USers
<hr/>

https://github.com/skinny-framework/skinny-framework/releases/tag/2.2.0

<hr/>
#### sbt 0.13.12

Skinny 2.2.0's blank project use `build.sbt` instead of `project/Build.scala` because since 0.13.12, sbt marks the Build trait deprecated and will remove it since version 1.0.

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/2530

The migration from your existing `project/Build.scala` to `build.sbt` is not difficult. But if you're stuck with it, check the default settings in skinny-blank-app.

###### Remove the build object

In `build.sbt`, you don't need a parent object which extends Build trait. Just remove it.

```scala
object SkinnyAppBuild extends Build {
}
```

###### Migrate project definition DSL

In `build.sbt`, the DSL to define projects is different from `project/Build.scala`. Migrate `Project(...)`

```scala
  lazy val dev = Project(id = "dev", base = file("."),
    settings = devBaseSettings ++ Seq(
      name := appName + "-dev",
      target := baseDirectory.value / "target" / "dev"
    )
  )
```

to `(project in file(dir)).settings(...)` like this:

```scala
lazy val dev = (project in file(".")).settings(devBaseSettings).settings(
  name := appName + "-dev",
  target := baseDirectory.value / "target" / "dev"
)
```

##### Limitation

Unfortunately, `build.sbt` doesn't allow defining multiple sub projects which share the same base directory. Due to the limitation, the precompileDev project is disabled by default since 2.2.0. If you prefer using precompileDev project, modify `build.sbt` after creating a skinny project.

### 2.1 Migration Guide for 2.0.x Users
<hr/>

https://github.com/skinny-framework/skinny-framework/releases/tag/2.1.0

<hr/>
#### ScalikeJDBC 2.4 Compatible

Although there is no API changes, Skinny ORM and related modules are compatible with ScalikeJDBC 2.4.0 or higher.

You cannot use ScalikeJDBC 2.3.x or lower version with Skinny modules 2.1.0.

### 2.0 Migration Guide for 1.3.x Users
<hr/>

https://github.com/skinny-framework/skinny-framework/releases/tag/2.0.0

<hr/>
#### Moving from Scalatra to Skinny Micro

The biggest change is moving from Scalatra to Skinny Micro. We recommend you checking the 2.0.0 blank project first.

If you're in trouble for replacing Scalatra with Skinny Micro, please post questsions on Google Group or stackoverflow.com.

- http://skinny-framework.org/documentation/micro.html
- https://github.com/skinny-framework/skinny-micro

You'll see deprecation warnings that point you which class to use when upgrading Skinny to 2.0.
So We believe the migration should be very smooth. But in some cases, you might be in trouble.
In particular, be careful about the following things:

- Replace `org.scalatra.servlet.ScalatraListener` with `skinny.micro.SkinnyListener` in src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml
- Rename src/main/scala/ScalatraBoostrap.scala to src/main/scala/Bootstrap.scala
- Replace all things that depend on `org.scalatra` package with new ones under `skinny.micro` (also for tests)
- Fix some compilation errors due to renaming or removing existing traits (not so many)

<hr/>
#### Use json4s 3.3.x 

Skinny Framework 2.0 is compatible with json4s 3.3.x. Be aware that 3.2.x series will be incompatible.


<hr/>
### 1.3 Migration Guide for 1.2.x Users
<hr/>

https://github.com/skinny-framework/skinny-framework/releases/tag/1.3.0

Deprecated joda-time methods in WrappedResultSet are removed. If you you're using `rs.dateTime(...)`, just rename it to `rs.jodaDateTime(...)`.

<hr/>
### 1.2 Migration Guide for 1.1.x Users
<hr/>

APIs are basically compatible. If you don't have some extensions that depend on `LocaleFeature`, `RequestScopeFeature` and `SkinnySessionFilter` methods, 
your app will work fine without changing your code.

https://github.com/skinny-framework/skinny-framework/releases/tag/1.2.0

Though we believe migration is not difficult, please tell us here if you find something wrong.

<hr/>
### 1.1 Migration Guide for 1.0.x Users
<hr/>

Skinny 1.1 APIs are basically compatible with Skinny 1.0 though the release includes basic dependencies' major upgrades. 
If your app depends on the dependencies directly (not via Skinny APIs), you may need to update your code.

- All the components run on Scala 2.11 or Scala 2.10 (Skinny 1.0: Scala 2.10)
- Web framework runs on Java 7 or higher (Skinny 1.0: Java 6 or higher) 
- Web framework is compatible with Servlet API 3.1 (Skinny 1.0: Servlet 3.0)
- Web framework depends on Scalatra 2.3 (Skinny 1.0: Scalatra 2.2)
- ORM depends on ScalikeJDBC 2.0 (Skinny 1.0: ScalikeJDBC 1.8)
- Migration command depends on Flyway 3.0 (Skinny 1.0: Flyway 2.3)
- Test support depends on ScalaTest 2.2 (Skinny 1.0: ScalaTest 1.9)

https://github.com/skinny-framework/skinny-framework/releases/tag/1.1.0

Though we believe migration is not difficult, please tell us here if you find something wrong.

<hr/>
#### "org.scalatest.matchers.ShouldMatchers" is deprecated

Use "org.scalatest.Matchers" instead. Sorry to say this.

<hr/>
#### Importing "scalikejdbc.SQLInterpolation._" is deprecated

Just import only "scalikejdbc._".

<hr/>
#### Renamed joda-time APIs due to JSR-310

`WrappedResultSet#dateTime`, `#localDate`, `#localTime` and `#localDateTime` are deprecated and `#jodaDateTime` and #jodaXXX are added.

<hr/>
#### skinny package's Scalate precompilation error

Since Scalate 1.7.0, Skinny's blank app project's settings fail to execute `package` command.

```
default_ssp.scala:7: $_scalate_$default_ssp is already defined as object $_scalate_$default_ssp
```

Remove scalateSettings if your build settings loads it twice.
